    id:                         the person’s id
    messages:                   how many messages the person needs to say before the bot automagically tells them to shut up
    auto:                       true/false, controls if the bot should tell the person to shut up automagically
    repeat:                     true/false, controls if the bot should repeat if someone else says shut up
    repeatSpeedUpAutoAmount:    the number to subtract or add to messages when someone says shut up, set to 0 to disable. You can also make this negative to add more wait.
